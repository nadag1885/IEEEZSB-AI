>>Binomial distributions:
The binomial distribution is a probability distribution
that describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials,
where each trial has the same probability of success.


>>the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of 
n elements without regard to order, can be expressed using factorials as follows:
p(k)= n!\k!(n−k)!


>>​For example, if you have
n=5 trials and you want to calculate 
 the calculation is straightforward:
p(k)=5!\2!⋅(5−2)!=5!\2!⋅3!=5⋅4\2⋅1=10

>>Binomial distributions are commonly used in various fields to model discrete events with two possible outcomes,
such as:
-Coin flipping (head or tail).
-Quality control and manufacturing processes.
-Binary classification problems in statistics and machine learning.
-Medical trials (e.g., drug efficacy studies).
-Election prediction (e.g., predicting the number of votes for a candidate).
